Raspberry Pi is a small, single-board computer developed for computer science education. A United Kingdom (UK) charitable organization called the Raspberry Pi Foundation developed the device. 
Raspberry PI is about the size of a credit card, has a 32-bit ARM processor and uses a Fedora distribution of Linux for its default operating system (OS). It can be programmed with Python or any other language that will compile for ARM v6.

The Raspberry Pi computer is essentially a system-on-a-chip (SoC) with connection ports. It can be operated by hooking up a USB keyboard and plugging the computer into a television.
